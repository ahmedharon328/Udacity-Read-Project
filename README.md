# Project Overview

In an existing project given to me by Udacity for my nanodegree course.


##  How to Run Appilcation

To run this application, you will need the following:

* Node.js
* The command line
* NPM


## How to use

*Once loaded you may choose which shelf to send a book to by clicking on the green circle with a down arrow of any book.
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

### Choosing which shelf to send a book to
Once loaded you may choose which shelf to send a book to by clicking on the green circle with a down arrow of any book.

### Search for a book to add to shelf
To access the search page select the plus icon located at the bottom right of the page. Type in the search field for possible books to be found. No results will be displayed if the input field is blank or the query you've typed does not exist.

To return to the main page you may use the back arrow in the input area at the top or the browsers back arrow.
